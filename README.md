I believe that different theoretical/practical problems just need different ways of _explaining reality_, _representing reality_, or _learning from data observed or experienceable in reality_, for a specific system, industry, or supply chain, to obtain feasible, logical, and optimal (or best possible) solutions, regions or policies. The way we algorithmize, model, and solve these problems to be _scalable_ and _stable_, both in computation _time_ and _accuracy_, matters a lot.
